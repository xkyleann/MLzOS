# z/OS and Machine Learning
- Machine learning models be applied to optimize CPU utilization, memory management, and transaction throughput in z/OS environments.
- Machine learning improve the accuracy of forecasting critical performance metrics in z/OS systems.

# Building the Program
1. **COBOL program**  to read performance data (e.g., SMF records) and write it to a dataset or file.
Code has to include:
- Read performance from SMF records.
- Simulate CPU usage, memory usage, and throughput values.
- Writes metrics to .txt file

2. **Python program** to process the dataset and build a basic machine learning model.
Code has to include:
- read .txt file that has generated by COBOL
- train a simple ML model to predict transaction throughput based on CPU and memory usage.
- For predicting transaction throughput **RandomForestGenerator** can be used.
- For model's performance **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
